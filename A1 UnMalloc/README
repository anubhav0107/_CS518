UNMALLOC:

Main Functions:
1) void * umalloc(size_t req_Size, char *file, int line)
• Checks whether the requested memory is available along with the additional metadata size.
• Scan entire memory until we reach a memory segment that is free and big enough to accommodate the block.
• Splits the memory into used and unused segments.

2) void ufree(void *addr_To_Free, char *file, int line)
• Checks if address to be freed is within memory range.
• Checks if memory has ever been allocated by malloc.
• Checks if memory is already free.
• Frees the blocks located at the pointer address provided accounting for the metadata and it returns an error if already freed.
